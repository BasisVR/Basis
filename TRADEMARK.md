# Trademark Policy

Source code comprising the Basis Framework is released subject to the MIT license. However, we require permission to use the logo and the Basis/BasisVR/Basis Framework names.

We encourage and authorize consumers of the framework to credit their projects with "Made with Basis" or "Built with Basis", or similar, to signal their usage. We request, however, that users of these marks to otherwise avoid claiming implicit or explicit affiliation or endorsement by the Basis Project without express written permission to do so.

Additionally, we would also like to avoid confusion between consumers of the products built using the Basis Framework and the Basis Project itself whenever possible. For example, although projects naming themselves "Basis 2" or "Basis Pro" or similar may not violate the source code license, unauthorized use of the trademark may cause unnecessary confusion.

We explicitly grant permission to use the name and logo for contributions made to the Basis Project, its documentation, or educational materials or tutorials for Basis. Additionally, we authorize use of the name and logo in text or video to truthfully refer to and/or link to the Basis Project and Framework.

If there is any confusion about these permissions, please get in touch so we can help clarify or improve our guidelines.

TL;DR:
* MIT covers the code; name/logo remain trademarked.
* Use “Built with Basis” descriptively - no implied endorsement.
* Don’t name forks using the Basis name i.e. “Basis 2/Pro”, or use the logo without permission.
* Contact us if unsure.
